This is basically BigBrother's raid consumables check without dependancies and automated detection of 10/25 man difficulty setting.

Usage:
	
- Create a macro with "/run Flasks:Check()"
- Normal click on the macro reports locally, Shift + Click reports to the raid chat.

Credit goes to Cryect's BigBrother from which I've taken the spellID table.
